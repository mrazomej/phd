<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In his classic 1944 book, Schrödinger brought to the attention of the scientific community what he thought were two of the biggest challenges we had ahead of us if we were to understand living systems in the same way we understand the electromagnetic field, or the universal law of gravitation <span class="citation" data-cites="Schrodinger1992"> [<a href="#ref-Schrodinger1992" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. The idea that living organisms could be “accounted for” by physics and chemistry brought with it a new agenda on what needed to be done in order to transition from a qualitative and descriptive study of the phenomena of life, to a quantitative and predictive science in the spirit of the physical sciences. Since the publication of the book there has been an enormous amount of progress on our understanding of living systems from a first principles perspective, nevertheless 75 years later and Schrödinger questions are still as relevant and as vibrant as ever before <span class="citation" data-cites="Phillips2021"> [<a href="#ref-Phillips2021" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>One of the defining features of living organisms at all scales is their capacity of gathering information from the environment, encode an internal representation of the state of the environment, and generate a response based on this information processing capacity. Researches in the the field of origins-of-life have gone as far as declaring that life emerged when chemical systems underwent a radical phase transition after which they were able to process and use information and free energy <span class="citation" data-cites="Cronin2016"> [<a href="#ref-Cronin2016" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. So, although speculative, it is highly probable that the physical theory that will fulfill Schrödinger’s vision of accounting for the phenomena of life, will be the physics of systems capable of processing information <span class="citation" data-cites="Davies2019"> [<a href="#ref-Davies2019" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In this context, information does not take the usual generic concept of possessing useful knowledge about something. The kind of information that I am referring to has a precise mathematical definition <span class="citation" data-cites="Adami2016"> [<a href="#ref-Adami2016" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. This formal definition of information makes it a metric worth quantifying and predicting in different biological context as theoretical studies suggest that natural selection might act on the ability of an organism to process information <span class="citation" data-cites="Taylor2007"> [<a href="#ref-Taylor2007" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. Working out the physical details of how it is that organisms sense the environment, this is, gather information about the state of the environment, encode such information in some shape or form within their physical boundaries, and take an action based on this information is at the core of the state-of-the-art research in biophysics <span class="citation" data-cites="Bialek2012"> [<a href="#ref-Bialek2012" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The present thesis is an effort towards this vision of understanding biological systems as information processing systems. Our object of study will be gene regulation in bacteria. This particular system has been the subject of study for microbiologists and molecular biologists for decades, and we have come to learn a lot about the microscopic mechanistic details of how bacteria turn on and off their transcriptional machinery <span class="citation" data-cites="Browning2004"> [<a href="#ref-Browning2004" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. In particular we will focus on what we think of as the “hydrogen atom” of gene regulation–the so-called simple-repression motif (more on that in the next section). In physics, calling something the hydrogen atom of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> means that for the area of study <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, this “something” represents the a system simple enough to be amenable to analytical models that can be solve by standard mathematical methods, but rich enough to capture the general features of the phenomena. This simple genetic circuit will allow us to write tractable mathematical models that will guide our experimental efforts with the ultimate goal of testing our understanding of such system when predicting how much information can a bacterium gather from the environment using this genetic module.</p>
<p>Professional biophysicists might wish to skip the rest of this chapter as we will lay the foundations needed for the rest of our enterprise. We will introduce the basics of gene expression modeling and the mathematical concept of information, and work through every single physical and mathematical prerequisite needed for the rest of the thesis. The following chapters are structured as follows: Chapter 2 builds on a decade of understanding this hydrogen atom of gene regulation, and expands the predictive ability of our models by including the effect of environmental effectors. What this means is that we will consider how gene regulation is affected by the presence of an extracellular inducer molecule. Chapter 3 will expand even further our predictive capacities by building a model capable of making predictions about the cell-to-cell variability inherent to all signaling systems working at the molecular scale. Chapter 4 serves as a Supporting Information section for Chapter 2, detailing every calculation and every inference. Likewise, Chapter 5 expands the on Chapter 3, explaining every technical detail.</p>
<h2 id="gene-regulation-as-a-physics-101-problem">Gene regulation as a Physics 101 problem</h2>
<p>As organisms navigate the challenges presented by the environment, they must constantly fight against the will of the second law of thermodynamics to bring them back to an equilibrium state. To face those challenges, cells are equipped with a toolkit of genes written in the language of A, T, C, and G of the genome. We can think of a typical bacteria genome with <span class="math inline">\(\approx 5\times 10^3\)</span> genes as the instruction manual to produce a repertoire of tools that allow cells to thrive under different circumstances that they face throughout their lives. But not all challenges are the same, and therefore not all tools are needed simultaneously. Therefore all organisms are faced with the challenge of orchestrating the expression of the correct subset molecular tools at their disposal when trying to survive on different environments. From cells in the fly embryo expressing different genes that will define their identity on the final body plan of the animal, to a simple bacteria expressing the correct enzymes to process the available nutrients in the environment.</p>
<p>Our understanding of how organisms regulate the expression of their genes is still not as thorough as one might expect given the amount of effort that has gone into this question. Take for example <em>E. coli</em>–arguably the most well characterized model organism–for which we know the regulatory scheme of less than 1/3 of its genes <span class="citation" data-cites="Ireland2020"> [<a href="#ref-Ireland2020" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>. For more complex organisms such as <em>Drosophila</em>, <em>C. elegans</em>, or even humans we are even more hopeless on getting a holistic view of the regulatory landscape. Nevertheless we would not be doing justice to the great advances in the field if we were to pretend we are completely ignorant about how gene regulation takes place in bacteria. There is a rich mechanistic understanding of how the transcriptional machinery takes the information contained in the DNA and transcribes it into RNA <span class="citation" data-cites="Browning2004"> [<a href="#ref-Browning2004" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. The relative simplicity of the process has inspired generations of biophysicists to try to write down minimal models that can describe and predict features of the process of gene regulation <span class="citation" data-cites="Ackers1982 Bintu2005 Kuhlman2007"> [<a href="#ref-Ackers1982" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>–<a href="#ref-Kuhlman2007" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>These modeling efforts come into two main flavors: equilibrium statistical mechanical models, and kinetic models. In the following sections we will introduce the necessary background for both approaches relevant to the rest of the thesis.</p>
<h3 id="minimal-model-of-gene-expression">Minimal model of gene expression</h3>
<p>Let us begin our introduction to gene expression modeling with the simplest example. As shown in</p>

<h3 id="the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-unrealistic-simplifications">The unreasonable effectiveness of unrealistic simplifications</h3>
<p>On the preface of the textbook <em>Molecular Driving Forces</em> Dill and Bromberg introduce the idea of Statistical Mechanics as <em>the unreasonable effectiveness of unrealistic simplifications <span class="citation" data-cites="Dill2010"> [<a href="#ref-Dill2010" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>. Although one could make the case that all of physics follows this description, it is certainly evident that statistical mechanics is a vivid example of how simple ideas can have profound consequences. Statistical mechanics can be simply defined as the theory that, upon assuming the atomic nature of matter, explains the phenomenology that classical thermodynamics established <span class="citation" data-cites="Dill2010"> [<a href="#ref-Dill2010" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> from the interactions of the microscopic components of a system. As with any other physical theory, statistical mechanics is built from a set of </em>empirical* facts that define axioms that we take to be truth. In other words, as Feynman famously described to us: if we want to come up with a new law of nature there is a simple recipe that we must follow: 1. We guess the law. Literally. The deepest understanding of physical reality we have up to now come from educated guesses made after a careful observation of nature. 2. We compute the consequences of such guess. That is why mathematical theories allow us to sharpen our statements about how nature works 3. We compare with experiments/observations. The scientific revolution came about when, after the dark ages, we finally learned it was okay to say “we don’t know.”</p>
<p>In such simple statement, Feynman tells us, lies the key to science <span class="citation" data-cites="Feynman1965"> [<a href="#ref-Feynman1965" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>. For our purpose of understanding the basis of statistical mechanics one could argue that the main law upon which the field is founded is given by Boltzmann’s law <span class="math display">\[
\frac{P(E_1)}{P(E_2)} = \frac{e^{-E_1 / k_BT}}{e^{-E_2 / k_BT}}.
\label{eq:boltzmann_law}
\]</span> Let us unpack this equation. The main idea behind statistical mechanics is that macroscopic observables (temperature, pressure, specific heat in classic examples) are emergent properties dictated by the dynamics of the microscopic components of the system. What Boltzmann’s law tells us is that the relative probability of a system in thermal equilibrium to be found in a particular microstate with energy <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> compared to being in a microstate with energy <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> is given by an exponential function of minus the energy of such microstate divided by <span class="math inline">\(k_BT\)</span>, the thermal energy. To give concrete examples of what a microstate can look like, Fig. 2(A) shows three molecular systems relevant for biology. On the first example we have the classic ligand-receptor binding problem; here we imagine that a solution can be discretized into a series of small boxes. In each of these boxes one and only one ligand molecule can fit in. In principle we can list all possible spatial arrangements of ligands. We could then calculate the relative likelihood of finding the system in any of the configurations as long as we can assign an energy value to each of them. The second example focuses on ligand-gated ion channels. In this particular system we care about the state of the ion channel itself–either open or close–and the binding configuration of the ligands. If the channel responds to the concentration of the ligand by changing its probability of gating, that is something we can calculate using equilibrium statistical mechanics. Finally, the third example shows different configurations of a small patch of cell membrane. All deformations of a membrane have energetic costs associated with them. So listing all possible microstates of the system we can calculate what is the most likely configuration that we could find a membrane given the forces and stresses acting on the membrane.</p>
<p>The macroscopic states that we get to observe can then be thought of as a coarse-graining of many microstates into a single macrostate. For example, in the case of the ligand-receptor binding, we rarely would care about the specific position of all the ligand molecules in the solution. What we would be interested in is whether or not the ligand is bound to the receptor. We can therefore define as our “macrostate” the particular configuration of the receptor as schematically shown in Fig. 2(B).</p>

<p>If we want to know the likelihood of finding a particular system in any specific configurationBoltzmann’s law (Eq. <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:boltzmann_law}\)</span>) is then telling us a protocol we must follow: 1. Enumerate all possible microstates in which the system can be found. 2. Compute the energy of each of these microstates. 3. Compute the Boltzmann factor by exponentiating minus the energy divided by the thermal energy.</p>
