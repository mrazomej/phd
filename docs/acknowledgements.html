                        <p>The opportunity to reflect on having had the experience to do a Ph.D. at an institution of Caltech’s caliber brought me with it a deep reflection of how unlikely my twenties were. Ten years ago, when my adventure into science began, I was just a naive kid with a romantic view of what being a scientist meant and with no real hands-on experience to back up any of such idealized views. On paper, I was not supposed to be here. Not only I graduated from an institution that nobody ever heard about, but I was explicitly told by my professors at this institution that I was “just a kid from Mexico” and that I was not going to amount to much. My big dreams of making it out of my situation to study abroad and dedicate my life to understanding the natural world were almost shattered beyond repair. During this absolute low point of my life, a series of fortunate events got me here, writing my thesis’s acknowledgments section. This journey over the last decade has only been possible because I have had the immense fortune of being surrounded by incredible people. I want to take this chance to recall the story of how I got into Caltech, hopefully thanking every person that has helped me reach this moment along the way.</p>
<p>As I just mentioned, before coming to Caltech for the first time, my scientific credentials were next to null. Circumstances I did not choose had me stuck in an unfavorable situation where almost every professor at my college thought of me as “a stubborn and hard-headed guy, too ambitious for his good.” Multiple attempts to bring my spirit down were starting to be successful, as I seriously considered dropping out of college to try my luck with something else. This is where the first big name on this story appeared. Adrian Jinich, back then a staff scientist at a nearby research center and a soon-to-be graduate student at Harvard, came to my middle-of-nowhere school with a simple idea: He was going to inspire the next generation of Mexican scientists by working with students on a hands-on project. Those Saturday meetings with Adrian were going to change my life in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Adrian happened to have a textbook that has guided my thinking and my love for science for the last decade and, with a little bit of more luck, will continue to do so for decades to come. This textbook, Physical Biology of the Cell, by Rob Phillips, Jane Kondev, Julie Theriot, and Hernan Garcia instantly became a pseudo-religious bible to me. Since I was not learning anything useful in school, I dedicated countless hours to understanding the contents of this textbook. And, on a lonely night of April 2011, when I was feeling more desperate than ever after having gotten into a heated discussion with one of my professors, I sent an innocent email to the first author of the book with zero expectations of ever receiving a reply. The email said something like this</p>
<p>Dear Professor Phillips PhD,</p>
<p>My name is Manuel Razo, I’m a Mexican student in the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico… The reason for writing you this letter is because I’ve been studying your book… I found fascinating every single page in the book, to the point that I’m looking forward to work one day in a topic related with biophysics…I know that you are a very busy and important Scientist, but it would mean a lot to me if you could give me any advice of what to do in order to achieve my goals.</p>
<p>Little I knew that this innocent email would set my career path for the rest of my life. This was because a few weeks after sending this email, Mr. Phillips took the time to reply to the message, giving me inspiring words about the way he sees life and the meaning of being a scientist. One conversation led to another, and sooner than I realized, Rob challenged me to come up with a project to work on during a summer internship. Talks with Adrian and a lot of reading led me to an idea. I wrote down this proposal and sent it to Rob. At this time, I did not know what to expect. I had never been involved in any research project or knew what it took to become a Caltech summer student. But, to my fortune, Rob liked my naive idea and invited me to spend not only the summer but an entire year working in his lab. There I was, a nobody with no credentials being given the opportunity of my life.</p>
<p>That year, my horizons expanded like never before. I passed from only interacting with people with my cultural background that spoke my language to be in an incredibly diverse and stimulating environment that encouraged bold ideas. At that time, I met two people that became mentors and friends. James Boedicker, a postdoc in the lab at the time, now a tenured faculty member at USC, went beyond what he needed to when he taught me how to do experiments. He taught me how to use a micropipette, grow bacteria, and organize experimental work. But his mentoring and advice went beyond lab work. He and his wife Amy invited me for lunch or dinner on several occasions since they knew I was on an extremely tight budget. James became my second mentor and my primary guide when it came time to apply to grad school. His kindness, patience, and caring showed me that there are multiple facets to every society. Although the news wanted me to believe that every person in this country automatically hated me because of my nationality, James’ friendship shattered all dumb preconceptions I could have had.</p>
<p>If there is something I did not expect to come across in a place like Caltech, that would be Ernie’s Mexican food truck’s enormous popularity. It was during the classic Thursday visits to Ernie’s truck that I got to interact with Justin Bois. At the time, Justin was doing his second postdoc at UCLA. He would come once a week during our group meeting to have the chance to hang out with other physical biologists. Rob decided to recruit Justin and me as honorary TAs for his famous Bi1x class. Every Sunday for the next few months, I helped Justin develop a new module for the class involving fluorescent microscopy on fly embryos. These interactions turned into a friendship where Justin went beyond what he had to and treated my family and me unbelievably nicely.</p>
<p>After Rob, Justin has been the scientist that has influenced my thinking the most. His classes, sharp mind, computational skills, unbelievably ethical behavior, and his will to share his knowledge set me on the right track from the beginning of my Ph.D. when Justin started a position as a teaching faculty for the Biology division. Because of course, I had to come back to Caltech. A year was not enough, and I needed more. So as soon as I could, I came back to begin my Ph.D. working again with Rob.</p>
<p>My twenties came and went by faster than I thought. Nevertheless, I had the immense fortune to share the lab with three of my great friends and co-authors for all those years. Nathan Belliveau, Muir Morrison, and Griffin Chure became my lab family. They helped me think through problems and worked with me on numerous successful (and unsuccessful) projects, as we all grew as scientists under Rob’s tutelage. It is not an exaggeration when I say that their friendship and support have been a fundamental part of why my Ph.D. experience has been the best time of my life. I would not do justice to Griffin’s influence on my thinking if I did not give a special shout-out to him. For the past seven years, Griffin and I talked almost every single day. We fed off each other’s ideas and together traveled the world. From Korea to New Zealand to Sweden, Griffin became my closest collaborator and someone that every time he has something to say, I am ready to take notes on whatever comes out of his creative and rigorous mind.</p>
