<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors which enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Understanding how organisms sense and respond to changes in their environment has long been a central theme of biological inquiry. At the cellular level, this interaction is mediated by a diverse collection of molecular signaling pathways. A pervasive mechanism of signaling in these pathways is allosteric regulation, in which the binding of a ligand induces a conformational change in some target molecule, triggering a signaling cascade <span class="citation" data-cites="Lindsley2006">(<a href="#ref-Lindsley2006" role="doc-biblioref">Lindsley and Rutter, 2006</a>)</span>. One of the most important examples of such signaling is offered by transcriptional regulation, where a transcription factor’s propensity to bind to DNA will be altered upon binding to an allosteric effector.</p>
<p>Despite allostery’s ubiquity, we lack a formal, rigorous, and generalizable framework for studying its effects across the broad variety of contexts in which it appears. A key example of this is transcriptional regulation, in which allosteric transcription factors can be induced or corepressed by binding to a ligand. An allosteric transcription factor can adopt multiple conformational states, each of which has its own affinity for the ligand and for its DNA target site. <em>In vitro</em> studies have rigorously quantified the equilibria of different conformational states for allosteric transcription factors and measured the affinities of these states to the ligand <span class="citation" data-cites="Harman2001 Lanfranco2017">(<a href="#ref-Harman2001" role="doc-biblioref">Harman, 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-Lanfranco2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lanfranco et al., 2017</a>)</span>. In spite of these experimental observations, the lack of a coherent quantitative model for allosteric transcriptional regulation has made it impossible to predict the behavior of even a simple genetic circuit across a range of regulatory parameters.</p>
<p>The ability to predict circuit behavior robustly— that is, across both broad ranges of parameters and regulatory architectures —is important for multiple reasons. First, in the context of a specific gene, accurate prediction demonstrates that all components relevant to the gene’s behavior have been identified and characterized to sufficient quantitative precision. Second, in the context of genetic circuits in general, robust prediction validates the model that generated the prediction. Possessing a validated model also has implications for future work. For example, when we have sufficient confidence in the model, a single data set can be used to accurately extrapolate a system’s behavior in other conditions. Moreover, there is an essential distinction between a predictive model, which is used to predict a system’s behavior given a set of input variables, and a retroactive model, which is used to describe the behavior of data that has already been obtained. We note that even some of the most careful and rigorous analysis of transcriptional regulation often entails only a retroactive reflection on a single experiment. This raises the fear that each regulatory architecture may require a unique analysis that cannot carry over to other systems, a worry that is exacerbated by the prevalent use of phenomenological functions (e.g. Hill functions or ratios of polynomials) that can analyze a single data set but cannot be used to extrapolate a system’s behavior in other conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="Setty2003 Poelwijk2011 Vilar2013 Rogers2015 Rohlhill2017">(<a href="#ref-Poelwijk2011" role="doc-biblioref">Poelwijk et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-Rogers2015" role="doc-biblioref">Rogers et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Rohlhill2017" role="doc-biblioref">Rohlhill et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-Setty2003" role="doc-biblioref">Setty et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-Vilar2013" role="doc-biblioref">Vilar and Saiz, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This work explores what happens when theory takes center stage, namely, we first write down the equations governing a system and describe its expected behavior across a wide array of experimental conditions, and only then do we set out to experimentally confirm these results. Building upon previous work <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011 Brewster2014 Weinert2014">(<a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brewster et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips, 2011a</a>; <a href="#ref-Weinert2014" role="doc-biblioref">Weinert et al., 2014</a>)</span> and the work of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux <span class="citation" data-cites="MONOD1965">(<a href="#ref-MONOD1965" role="doc-biblioref">Monod et al., 1965</a>)</span>, we present a statistical mechanical rendering of allostery in the context of induction and corepression (shown schematically in and henceforth referred to as the MWC model) and use it as the basis of parameter-free predictions which we then test experimentally. More specifically, we study the simple repression motif – a widespread bacterial genetic regulatory architecture in which binding of a transcription factor occludes binding of an RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting transcription initiation. The MWC model stipulates that an allosteric protein fluctuates between two distinct conformations – an active and inactive state – in thermodynamic equilibrium <span class="citation" data-cites="MONOD1965">(<a href="#ref-MONOD1965" role="doc-biblioref">Monod et al., 1965</a>)</span>. During induction, for example, effector binding increases the probability that a repressor will be in the inactive state, weakening its ability to bind to the promoter and resulting in increased expression. To test the predictions of our model across a wide range of operator binding strengths and repressor copy numbers, we design an <em>E. coli</em> genetic construct in which the binding probability of a repressor regulates gene expression of a fluorescent reporter.</p>
<p>In total, the work presented here demonstrates that one extremely compact set of parameters can be applied self-consistently and predictively to different regulatory situations including simple repression on the chromosome, cases in which decoy binding sites for repressor are put on plasmids, cases in which multiple genes compete for the same regulatory machinery, cases involving multiple binding sites for repressor leading to DNA looping, and induction by signaling <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011 Garcia2011B Brewster2012 Boedicker2013a Boedicker2013b Brewster2014">(<a href="#ref-Boedicker2013b" role="doc-biblioref">Boedicker et al., 2013a</a>, <a href="#ref-Boedicker2013a" role="doc-biblioref">2013b</a>; <a href="#ref-Brewster2012" role="doc-biblioref">Brewster et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brewster et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips, 2011a</a>; <a href="#ref-Garcia2011B" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia et al., 2011b</a>)</span>. Thus, rather than viewing the behavior of each circuit as giving rise to its own unique input-output response, the MWC model provides a means to characterize these seemingly diverse behaviors using a single unified framework governed by a small set of parameters.</p>

<p>We begin by considering a simple repression genetic architecture in which the binding of an allosteric repressor occludes the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the DNA <span class="citation" data-cites="Ackers1982 Buchler2003">(<a href="#ref-Ackers1982" role="doc-biblioref">Ackers et al., 1982</a>; <a href="#ref-Buchler2003" role="doc-biblioref">Buchler et al., 2003</a>)</span>. When an effector (hereafter referred to as an "inducer" for the case of induction) binds to the repressor, it shifts the repressor’s allosteric equilibrium towards the inactive state as specified by the MWC model <span class="citation" data-cites="MONOD1965">(<a href="#ref-MONOD1965" role="doc-biblioref">Monod et al., 1965</a>)</span>. This causes the repressor to bind more weakly to the operator, which increases gene expression. Simple repression motifs in the absence of inducer have been previously characterized by an equilibrium model where the probability of each state of repressor and RNAP promoter occupancy is dictated by the Boltzmann distribution <span class="citation" data-cites="Ackers1982 Buchler2003 Vilar2003 Bintu2005a Garcia2011 Brewster2014">(<a href="#ref-Ackers1982" role="doc-biblioref">Ackers et al., 1982</a>; <a href="#ref-Bintu2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Bintu et al., 2005a</a>; <a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brewster et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-Buchler2003" role="doc-biblioref">Buchler et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips, 2011a</a>; <a href="#ref-Vilar2003" role="doc-biblioref">Vilar and Leibler, 2003</a>)</span> (we note that non-equilibrium models of simple repression have been shown to have the same functional form that we derive below <span class="citation" data-cites="Phillips2015a">(<a href="#ref-Phillips2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Phillips, 2015</a>)</span>). We extend these models to consider allostery by accounting for the equilibrium state of the repressor through the MWC model.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic models of gene expression begin by enumerating all possible states of the promoter and their corresponding statistical weights. As shown in , the promoter can either be empty, occupied by RNAP, or occupied by either an active or inactive repressor. The probability of binding to the promoter will be affected by the protein copy number, which we denote as <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> for RNAP, <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> for active repressor, and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> for inactive repressor. We note that repressors fluctuate between the active and inactive conformation in thermodynamic equilibrium, such that <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> will remain constant for a given inducer concentration <span class="citation" data-cites="MONOD1965">(<a href="#ref-MONOD1965" role="doc-biblioref">Monod et al., 1965</a>)</span>. We assign the repressor a different DNA binding affinity in the active and inactive state. In addition to the specific binding sites at the promoter, we assume that there are <span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>N</em><em>S</em></sub></span> non-specific binding sites elsewhere (i.e. on parts of the genome outside the simple repression architecture) where the RNAP or the repressor can bind. All specific binding energies are measured relative to the average non-specific binding energy. Thus, <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> represents the energy difference between the specific and non-specific binding for RNAP to the DNA. Likewise, <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>I</em></sub></span> represent the difference in specific and non-specific binding energies for repressor in the active or inactive state, respectively.</p>

<p>The formula presented in enables us to make precise quantitative statements about induction profiles. Motivated by the broad range of predictions implied by , we designed a series of experiments using the <em>lac</em> system in <em>E. coli</em> to tune the control parameters for a simple repression genetic circuit. As discussed in , previous studies from our lab have provided well-characterized values for many of the parameters in our experimental system, leaving only the values of the the MWC parameters (<span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>) to be determined.

These differences relative to our experimental conditions and fitting techniques led us to believe that it was important to perform our own analysis of these parameters. After inferring these three MWC parameters (see , Section "" for details regarding the inference of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>, which was fitted separately from <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>), we were able to predict the input/output response of the system under a broad range of experimental conditions.

<p>We test our model by predicting the induction profiles for an array of strains that could be made using previously characterized repressor copy numbers and DNA binding energies. Our approach contrasts with previous studies that have parameterized induction curves of simple repression motifs, as these have relied on expression systems where proteins are expressed from plasmids, resulting in highly variable and unconstrained copy numbers <span class="citation" data-cites="Murphy2007 Daber2009 Murphy2010 Daber2011a Sochor2014">(<a href="#ref-Daber2009" role="doc-biblioref">Daber et al., 2009</a>, <a href="#ref-Daber2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; <a href="#ref-Murphy2007" role="doc-biblioref">Murphy et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#ref-Murphy2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>; <a href="#ref-Sochor2014" role="doc-biblioref">Sochor, 2014</a>)</span>.

This includes work from our laboratory that used <em>E. coli</em> constructs based on components of the <em>lac</em> system to demonstrate how the Lac repressor (LacI) copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> and operator binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> affect gene expression in the absence of inducer <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011">(<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips, 2011a</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="Rydenfelt2014B"><a href="#ref-Rydenfelt2014B" role="doc-biblioref">Rydenfelt et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Rydenfelt2014B" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> extended the theory used in that work to the case of multiple promoters competing for a given transcription factor, which was validated experimentally by <span class="citation" data-cites="Brewster2014"><a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brewster et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, who modified this system to consider expression from multiple-copy plasmids as well as the presence of competing repressor binding sites.</p>
<p>The present study extends this body of work by introducing three additional biophysical parameters – <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> – which capture the allosteric nature of the transcription factor and complement the results shown by <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Brewster2014"><a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brewster et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Brewster2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>.

As explained in that Section, this additional data set is critical because multiple degenerate sets of parameters can characterize an induction curve equally well, with the <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> parameter compensated by the inducer dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> (see ). After fixing <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> as described in the , we can use data from single-site simple repression systems to determine the values of <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>.</p>

We then use to predict gene expression for any concentration of inducer, repressor copy number, and DNA binding energy and compare these predictions against experimental measurements. To obtain induction profiles for a set of strains with varying repressor copy numbers, we used modified <em>lacI</em> ribosomal binding sites from <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>)</span> to generate strains with mean repressor copy number per cell of <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 22 ± 4</span>, <span class="math inline">60 ± 20</span>, <span class="math inline">124 ± 30</span>, <span class="math inline">260 ± 40</span>, <span class="math inline">1220 ± 160</span>, and <span class="math inline">1740 ± 340</span>, where the error denotes standard deviation of at least three replicates as measured by <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>)</span>.

We measure YFP fluorescence using flow cytometry and automatically gate the data to include only single-cell measurements (see , Section ""). To validate the use of flow cytometry, we also measured the fold-change of a subset of strains using the established method of single-cell microscopy (see Appendix <a href="#AppendixMicroscopy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="AppendixMicroscopy">[AppendixMicroscopy]</a>).

<p>We stress that the entire suite of predictions in is based upon the induction profile of a single strain. Our ability to make such a broad range of predictions stems from the fact that our parameters of interest - such as the repressor copy number and DNA binding energy - appear as distinct physical parameters within our model. While the single data set in could also be fit using a Hill function, such an analysis would be unable to predict any of the other curves in the figure (see , Section "").

<p>We tested the predictions shown in by measuring fold-change induction profiles in strains with a broad range of repressor copy numbers and repressor binding energies as characterized in <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>)</span>. With a few notable exceptions, the results shown in demonstrate agreement between theory and experiment. We note that there was an apparently systematic shift in the O3 <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 9.7 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> strains () and all of the <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 1220</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 1740</span> strains. This may be partially due to imprecise previous determinations of their <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> values. By performing a global fit where we infer all parameters including the repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> and the binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span>, we found better agreement for these strains, although a discrepancy in the steepness of the response for all O3 strains remains (see , Section ""). We considered a number of hypotheses to explain these discrepancies such as including other states (e.g. non-negligible binding of the inactive repressor), relaxing the weak promoter approximation, and accounting for variations in gene and repressor copy number throughout the cell cycle, but none explained the observed discrepancies. As an additional test of our model, we considered strains using the synthetic Oid operator which exhibits an especially strong binding energy of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 17 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011">(<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips, 2011a</a>)</span>.

<p>To ensure that the agreement between our predictions and data is not an accident of the strain we used to perform our fitting, we also inferred <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> from each of the other strains.

<p>A subset of the properties shown in (i.e. the leakiness, saturation, dynamic range, <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, and effective Hill coefficient) are of significant interest to synthetic biology. For example, synthetic biology is often focused on generating large responses (i.e. a large dynamic range) or finding a strong binding partner (i.e. a small <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>) <span class="citation" data-cites="Brophy2014 Shis2014">(<a href="#ref-Brophy2014" role="doc-biblioref">Brophy and Voigt, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-Shis2014" role="doc-biblioref">Shis et al., 2014</a>)</span>. While these properties are all individually informative, when taken together they capture the essential features of the induction response. We reiterate that a Hill function approach cannot predict these features <em>a priori</em> and furthermore requires fitting each curve individually. The MWC model, on the other hand, enables us to quantify how each trait depends upon a single set of physical parameters as shown by -.</p>
<p>We define these five phenotypic traits using expressions derived from the model, . These results build upon extensive work by <span class="citation" data-cites="Martins2011"><a href="#ref-Martins2011" role="doc-biblioref">Martins and Swain</a> (<a href="#ref-Martins2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, who computed many such properties for ligand-receptor binding within the MWC model. We begin by analyzing the leakiness, which is the minimum fold-change observed in the absence of ligand, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
 \label{eqLeakiness}
\text{leakiness} &amp;= \text{fold-change}(c=0) \nonumber\\

<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

<p>Systems that minimize leakiness repress strongly in the absence of effector while systems that maximize saturation have high expression in the presence of effector.

In the , Section "“, we show that the large, asymmetric error bars for the O3 <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 22</span> strain arise from its nearly flat response, where the lack of dynamic range makes it impossible to determine the value of the inducer dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span>, as can be seen in the uncertainty of both the <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span> and effective Hill coefficient.

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="data-collapse-of-induction-profiles">Data Collapse of Induction Profiles</h2>
<p>Our primary interest heretofore was to determine the system response at a specific inducer concentration, repressor copy number, and repressor-DNA binding energy. However, the cell does not necessarily “care about” the precise number of repressors in the system or the binding energy of an individual operator. The relevant quantity for cellular function is the fold-change enacted by the regulatory system. This raises the question: given a specific value of the fold-change, what combination of parameters will give rise to this desired response? In other words, what trade-offs between the parameters of the system will give rise to the same mean cellular output? These are key questions both for understanding how the system is governed and for engineering specific responses in a synthetic biology context. To address these questions, we follow the data collapse strategy used in a number of previous studies <span class="citation" data-cites="Sourjik2002 Keymer2006 Swem2008">(<a href="#ref-Keymer2006" role="doc-biblioref">Keymer et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-Sourjik2002" role="doc-biblioref">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-Swem2008" role="doc-biblioref">Swem et al., 2008</a>)</span>, and rewrite as a Fermi function, <span class="math display">$$\label{eq_free_energy_definition} \text{fold-change}= \frac{1}{1+e^{-

We note that elsewhere, this free energy has been dubbed the Bohr parameter since such families of curves are analogous to the shifts in hemoglobin binding curves at different pHs known as the Bohr effect <span class="citation" data-cites="Mirny2010 Phillips2015a Einav2016">(<a href="#ref-Einav2016" role="doc-biblioref">Einav et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-Mirny2010" role="doc-biblioref">Mirny, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-Phillips2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Phillips, 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of analyzing each induction curve individually, the free energy provides a natural means to simultaneously characterize the diversity in our eighteen induction profiles. demonstrates how the various induction curves from - all collapse onto a single master curve, where points from every induction profile that yield the same fold-change are mapped onto the same free energy. shows this data collapse for the 216 data points in -, demonstrating the close match between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements across all eighteen strains.</p>
<p>There are many different combinations of parameter values that can result in the same free energy as defined in . For example, suppose a system originally has a fold-change of 0.2 at a specific inducer concentration, and then operator mutations increase the <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> binding energy <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2012">(<a href="#ref-Garcia2012" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia et al., 2012</a>)</span>. While this serves to initially increase both the free energy and the fold-change, a subsequent increase in the repressor copy number could bring the cell back to the original fold-change level. Such trade-offs hint that there need not be a single set of parameters that evoke a specific cellular response, but rather that the cell explores a large but degenerate space of parameters with multiple, equally valid paths.</p>

<p>Although this body of work has done much to improve our understanding of allosteric transcription factors, there have been few attempts to explicitly connect quantitative models to experiments. Here, we generate a predictive model of allosteric transcriptional regulation and then test the model against a thorough set of experiments using well-characterized regulatory components.

This model combines both theoretical and experimental insights; for example, rather than considering gene expression directly we analyze the fold-change in expression, where the weak promoter approximation (see ) circumvents uncertainty in the RNAP copy number. The resulting model depended upon experimentally accessible parameters, namely, the repressor copy number, the repressor-DNA binding energy, and the concentration of inducer. We tested these predictions on a range of strains whose repressor copy number spanned two orders of magnitude and whose DNA binding affinity spanned 6 <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span>. We argue that one would not be able to generate such a wide array of predictions by using a Hill function, which abstracts away the biophysical meaning of the parameters into phenomenological parameters <span class="citation" data-cites="Forsen1995">(<a href="#ref-Forsen1995" role="doc-biblioref">Forsén and Linse, 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>More precisely, we tested our model in the context of a <em>lac</em>-based simple repression system by first determining the allosteric dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> from a single induction data set (O2 operator with binding energy <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub> =  − 13.9 <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span> and repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 260</span>) and then using these values to make parameter-free predictions of the induction profiles for seventeen other strains where <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> were varied significantly (see ). We next measured the induction profiles of these seventeen strains using flow cytometry and found that our predictions consistently and accurately captured the primary features for each induction data set, as shown in -. Importantly, we find that fitting <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> to data from any other strain would have resulted in nearly identical predictions (see and , Section ""). This suggests that a few carefully chosen measurements can lead to a deep quantitative understanding of how simple regulatory systems work without requiring an extensive sampling of strains that span the parameter space. Moreover, the fact that we could consistently achieve reliable predictions after fitting only two free parameters stands in contrast to the common practice of fitting several free parameters simultaneously, which can nearly guarantee an acceptable fit provided that the model roughly resembles the system response, regardless of whether the details of the model are tied to any underlying molecular mechanism.</p>
<p>Beyond observing changes in fold-change as a function of effector concentration, our application of the MWC model allows us to explicitly predict the values of the induction curves’ key parameters, namely, the leakiness, saturation, dynamic range, <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, and the effective Hill coefficient (see ). We are consistently able to accurately predict the leakiness, saturation, and dynamic range for each of the strains. For both the O1 and O2 data sets, our model also accurately predicts the effective Hill coefficient and <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, though these predictions for O3 are noticeably less accurate. While performing a global fit for all model parameters marginally improves the prediction for O3 (see , Section ""), we are still unable to accurately predict the effective Hill coefficient or the <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>. We further tried including additional states (such as allowing the inactive repressor to bind to the operator), relaxing the weak promoter approximation, accounting for changes in gene and repressor copy number throughout the cell cycle <span class="citation" data-cites="Jones2014a">(<a href="#ref-Jones2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Jones et al., 2014</a>)</span>, and refitting the original binding energies from <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011B"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011B" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011B" role="doc-biblioref">2011b</a>)</span>, but we were still unable to account for the O3 data. It remains an open question as to how the discrepancy between the theory and measurements for O3 can be reconciled.</p>
<p>The dynamic range, which is of considerable interest when designing or characterizing a genetic circuit, is revealed to have an interesting property: although changing the value of <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>R</em><em>A</em></sub></span> causes the dynamic range curves to shift to the right or left, each curve has the same shape and in particular the same maximum value. This means that strains with strong or weak binding energies can attain the same dynamic range when the value of <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> is tuned to compensate for the binding energy. This feature is not immediately apparent from the IPTG induction curves, which show very low dynamic ranges for several of the O1 and O3 strains. Without the benefit of models that can predict such phenotypic traits, efforts to engineer genetic circuits with allosteric transcription factors must rely on trial and error to achieve specific responses <span class="citation" data-cites="Rogers2015 Rohlhill2017">(<a href="#ref-Rogers2015" role="doc-biblioref">Rogers et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Rohlhill2017" role="doc-biblioref">Rohlhill et al., 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the diversity observed in the induction profiles of each of our strains, our data are unified by their reliance on fundamental biophysical parameters. In particular, we have shown that our model for fold-change can be rewritten in terms of the free energy , which encompasses all of the physical parameters of the system. This has proven to be an illuminating technique in a number of studies of allosteric proteins <span class="citation" data-cites="Sourjik2002 Keymer2006 Swem2008">(<a href="#ref-Keymer2006" role="doc-biblioref">Keymer et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-Sourjik2002" role="doc-biblioref">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-Swem2008" role="doc-biblioref">Swem et al., 2008</a>)</span>. Although it is experimentally straightforward to observe system responses to changes in effector concentration <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>, framing the input-output function in terms of <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> can give the misleading impression that changes in system parameters lead to fundamentally altered system responses. Alternatively, if one can find the "natural variable" that enables the output to collapse onto a single curve, it becomes clear that the system’s output is not governed by individual system parameters, but rather the contributions of multiple parameters that define the natural variable. When our fold-change data are plotted against the respective free energies for each construct, they collapse cleanly onto a single curve (see ). This enables us to analyze how parameters can compensate each other. For example, rather than viewing strong repression as a consequence of low IPTG concentration <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> or high repressor copy number <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>, we can now observe that strong repression is achieved when the free energy <span class="math inline"><em>F</em>(<em>c</em>) ≤  − 5<em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub><em>T</em></span>, a condition which can be reached in a number of ways.</p>
<p>While our experiments validated the theoretical predictions in the case of simple repression, we expect the framework presented here to apply much more generally to different biological instances of allosteric regulation. For example, we can use this model to study more complex systems such as when transcription factors interact with multiple operators <span class="citation" data-cites="Bintu2005">(<a href="#ref-Bintu2005" role="doc-biblioref">Bintu et al., 2005b</a>)</span>. We can further explore different regulatory configurations such as corepression, activation, and coactivation, each of which are found in <em>E. coli</em> (see Appendix <a href="#AppendixApplications" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="AppendixApplications">[AppendixApplications]</a>). This work can also serve as a springboard to characterize not just the mean but the full gene expression distribution and thus quantify the impact of noise on the system <span class="citation" data-cites="eldar2010">(<a href="#ref-eldar2010" role="doc-biblioref">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</a>)</span>. Another extension of this approach would be to theoretically predict and experimentally verify whether the repressor-inducer dissociation constants <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>I</em></sub></span> or the energy difference <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>ε</em><sub><em>A</em><em>I</em></sub></span> between the allosteric states can be tuned by making single amino acid substitutions in the transcription factor <span class="citation" data-cites="Daber2011a Phillips2015a">(<a href="#ref-Daber2011a" role="doc-biblioref">Daber et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-Phillips2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Phillips, 2015</a>)</span>. Finally, we expect that the kind of rigorous quantitative description of the allosteric phenomenon provided here will make it possible to construct biophysical models of fitness for allosteric proteins similar to those already invoked to explore the fitness effects of transcription factor binding site strengths and protein stability <span class="citation" data-cites="Gerland2002 Berg2004 Zeldovich2008">(<a href="#ref-Berg2004" role="doc-biblioref">Berg et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-Gerland2002" role="doc-biblioref">Gerland and Hwa, 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-Zeldovich2008" role="doc-biblioref">Zeldovich and Shakhnovich, 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To conclude, we find that our application of the MWC model provides an accurate, predictive framework for understanding simple repression by allosteric transcription factors. To reach this conclusion, we analyzed the model in the context of a well-characterized system, in which each parameter had a clear biophysical meaning. As many of these parameters had been measured or inferred in previous studies, this gave us a minimal model with only two free parameters which we inferred from a single data set. We then accurately predicted the behavior of seventeen other data sets in which repressor copy number and repressor-DNA binding energy were systematically varied. In addition, our model allowed us to understand how key properties such as the leakiness, saturation, dynamic range, <span class="math inline">[<em>E</em><em>C</em><sub>50</sub>]</span>, and effective Hill coefficient depended upon the small set of parameters governing this system. Finally, we show that by framing inducible simple repression in terms of free energy, the data from all of our experimental strains collapse cleanly onto a single curve, illustrating the many ways in which a particular output can be targeted. In total, these results show that a thermodynamic formulation of the MWC model supersedes phenomenological fitting functions for understanding transcriptional regulation by allosteric proteins.</p>

<p>All strains used in these experiments were derived from <em>E. coli</em> K12 MG1655 with the <em>lac</em> operon removed, adapted from those created and described in <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011 Garcia2011B"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>; <a href="#ref-Garcia2011B" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia et al., 2011b</a>)</span>. Briefly, the operator variants and YFP reporter gene were cloned into a pZS25 background which contains a <em>lacUV5</em> promoter that drives expression as is shown schematically in .

These <em>lacI</em> constructs carried a chloramphenicol resistance gene and were integrated into the <em>ybcN</em> locus of the chromosome. Final strain construction was achieved by performing repeated P1 transduction <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomason2007">(<a href="#ref-Thomason2007" role="doc-biblioref">Thomason et al., 2007</a>)</span> of the different operator and <em>lacI</em> constructs to generate each combination used in this work. Integration was confirmed by PCR amplification of the replaced chromosomal region and by sequencing. Primers and final strain genotypes are listed in Appendix <a href="#AppendixStrainlist" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="AppendixStrainlist">[AppendixStrainlist]</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the rest of the <em>lac</em> operon (<em>lacZYA</em>) was never expressed. The LacY protein is a transmembrane protein which actively transports lactose as well as IPTG into the cell. As LacY was never produced in our strains, we assume that the extracellular and intracellular IPTG concentration was approximately equal due to diffusion across the membrane into the cell as is suggested by previous work <span class="citation" data-cites="FernandezCastane2012">(<a href="#ref-FernandezCastane2012" role="doc-biblioref">Fernández-Castané et al., 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To make this theory applicable to transcription factors with any number of DNA binding domains, we used a different definition for repressor copy number than has been used previously. We define the LacI copy number as the average number of repressor dimers per cell whereas in <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>)</span>, the copy number is defined as the average number of repressor tetramers in each cell. To motivate this decision, we consider the fact that the LacI repressor molecule exists as a tetramer in <em>E. coli</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Lewis1996">(<a href="#ref-Lewis1996" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis et al., 1996</a>)</span> in which a single DNA binding domain is formed from dimerization of LacI proteins, so that wild-type LacI might be described as dimer of dimers. Since each dimer is allosterically independent (i.e. either dimer can be allosterically active or inactive, independent of the configuration of the other dimer) <span class="citation" data-cites="Daber2009">(<a href="#ref-Daber2009" role="doc-biblioref">Daber et al., 2009</a>)</span>, a single LacI tetramer can be treated as two functional repressors. Therefore, we have simply multiplied the number of repressors reported in <span class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2011"><a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">Garcia and Phillips</a> (<a href="#ref-Garcia2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011a</a>)</span> by a factor of two. This factor is included as a keyword argument in the numerous Python functions used to perform this analysis, as discussed in the code documentation.</p>
<p>A subset of strains in these experiments were measured using fluorescence microscopy for validation of the flow cytometry data and results. To aid in the high-fidelity segmentation of individual cells, the strains were modified to constitutively express an mCherry fluorophore. This reporter was cloned into a pZS4*1 backbone <span class="citation" data-cites="Lutz1997">(<a href="#ref-Lutz1997" role="doc-biblioref">Lutz and Bujard, 1997</a>)</span> in which mCherry is driven by the <em>lacUV5</em> promoter. All microscopy and flow cytometry experiments were performed using these strains.</p>

<p>All measurements were performed with <em>E. coli</em> cells grown to mid-exponential phase in standard M9 minimal media (M9 5X Salts, Sigma-Aldrich M6030; <span class="math inline">2 mM</span> magnesium sulfate, Mallinckrodt Chemicals 6066-04; <span class="math inline">100 <em>μ</em>M</span> calcium chloride, Fisher Chemicals C79-500) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose. Briefly, <span class="math inline">500 <em>μ</em>L</span> cultures of <em>E. coli</em> were inoculated into Lysogeny Broth (LB Miller Powder, BD Medical) from a 50% glycerol frozen stock (-80<span class="math inline"><sup>∘</sup></span>C) and were grown overnight in a <span class="math inline">2 mL</span> 96-deep-well plate sealed with a breathable nylon cover (Lab Pak - Nitex Nylon, Sefar America Inc. Cat.

These were sealed with a breathable cover and were allowed to grow for approximately eight hours. Cells were then diluted ten-fold into a round-bottom 96-well plate (Corning Cat. No. 3365) containing <span class="math inline">90 <em>μ</em>L</span> of M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5% w/v glucose along with the corresponding IPTG concentrations. For each IPTG concentration, a stock of 100-fold concentrated IPTG in double distilled water was prepared and partitioned into <span class="math inline">100 <em>μ</em>L</span> aliquots. The same parent stock was used for all experiments described in this work.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="flow-cytometry">Flow Cytometry</h2>
<p>Unless explicitly mentioned, all fold-change measurements were collected on a Miltenyi Biotec MACSquant Analyzer 10 Flow Cytometer graciously provided by the Pamela Björkman lab at Caltech. Detailed information regarding the voltage settings of the photo-multiplier detectors can be found in Appendix Table <a href="#table_instrument_param" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table_instrument_param">[table_instrument_param]</a>. Prior to each day’s experiments, the analyzer was calibrated using MACSQuant Calibration Beads (Cat. No. 130-093-607) such that day-to-day experiments would be comparable. All YFP fluorescence measurements were collected via <span class="math inline">488 nm</span> laser excitation coupled with a 525/<span class="math inline">50 nm</span> emission filter.

Once completed, the data were extracted and immediately processed using the following methods.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="unsupervised-gating-of-flow-cytometry-data">Unsupervised Gating of Flow Cytometry Data</h2>
<p>Flow cytometry data will frequently include a number of spurious events or other undesirable data points such as cell doublets and debris. The process of restricting the collected data set to those data determined to be “real” is commonly referred to as gating. These gates are typically drawn manually <span class="citation" data-cites="Maecker2005">(<a href="#ref-Maecker2005" role="doc-biblioref">Maecker et al., 2005</a>)</span> and restrict the data set to those points which display a high degree of linear correlation between their forward-scatter (FSC) and side-scatter (SSC). The development of unbiased and unsupervised methods of drawing these gates is an active area of research <span class="citation" data-cites="Lo2008 Aghaeepour2013">(<a href="#ref-Aghaeepour2013" role="doc-biblioref">Aghaeepour et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-Lo2008" role="doc-biblioref">Lo et al., 2008</a>)</span>. For our purposes, we assume that the fluorescence level of the population should be log-normally distributed about some mean value. With this assumption in place, we developed a method that allows us to restrict the data used to compute the mean fluorescence intensity of the population to the smallest two-dimensional region of the <span class="math inline">log (<em>F</em><em>S</em><em>C</em>)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">log (<em>S</em><em>S</em><em>C</em>)</span> space in which 40% of the data is found. This was performed by fitting a bivariate Gaussian distribution and restricting the data used for calculation to those that reside within the 40th percentile. This procedure is described in more detail in the supplementary information as well as in a Jupyter notebook located in this paper’s <a href="https://rpgroup-pboc.github.io/mwc_induction/code/notebooks/unsupervised_gating.html">Github repository</a>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="experimental-determination-of-fold-change">Experimental Determination of Fold-Change</h2>
<p>For each strain and IPTG concentration, the fold-change in gene expression was calculated by taking the ratio of the population mean YFP expression in the presence of LacI repressor to that of the population mean in the absence of LacI repressor. However, the measured fluorescence intensity of each cell also includes the autofluorescence contributed by the weak excitation of the myriad protein and small molecules within the cell. To correct for this background, we computed the fold change as <span class="math display">$$\text{fold-change} = \frac{\langle I_{R &gt; 0} \rangle - \langle I_\text{auto}\rangle}{\langle I_{R = 0} \rangle - \langle I_\text{auto}\rangle},$$</span> where <span class="math inline">⟨<em>I</em><sub><em>R</em> &gt; 0</sub>⟩</span> is the average cell YFP intensity in the presence of repressor, <span class="math inline">⟨<em>I</em><sub><em>R</em> = 0</sub>⟩</span> is the average cell YFP intensity in the absence of repressor, and <span class="math inline">⟨<em>I</em><sub>auto</sub>⟩</span> is the average cell autofluorescence intensity, as measured from cells that lack the <em>lac</em>-YFP construct.</p>
