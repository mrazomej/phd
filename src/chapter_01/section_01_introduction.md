## Introduction

In his classic 1944 book, Schrödinger brought to the attention of the scientific
community what he thought were two of the biggest challenges we had ahead of us
if we were to understand living systems in the same way we understand the
electromagnetic field, or the universal law of gravitation [@Schrodinger1992].
The idea that living organisms could be "accounted for" by physics and chemistry
brought with it a new agenda on what needed to be done in order to transition
from a qualitative and descriptive study of the phenomena of life, to a
quantitative and predictive science in the spirit of the physical sciences.
Since the publication of the book there has been an enormous amount of progress
on our understanding of living systems from a first principles perspective,
nevertheless 75 years later and Schrödinger questions are still as relevant and
as vibrant as ever before [@Phillips2021]. 

One of the defining features of living organisms at all scales is their capacity
of gathering information from the environment, encode an internal representation
of the state of the environment, and generate a response based on this
information processing channel. Researches in the the field of origins-of-life
have gone as far as declaring that life emerged when chemical systems underwent
a radical phase transition after which they were able to process and use
information and free energy [@Cronin2016].
