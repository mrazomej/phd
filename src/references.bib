@article{Garcia2012,
abstract = {A canonical quantitative view of transcriptional regulation holds that the only role of operator sequence is to set the probability of transcription factor binding, with operator occupancy determining the level of gene expression. In this work, we test this idea by characterizing repression in vivo and the binding of RNA polymerase in vitro in experiments where operators of various sequences were placed either upstream or downstream from the promoter in . Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.},

@article{Frank2013,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: Biological systems produce outputs in response to variable inputs. Input-output relations tend to follow a few regular patterns. For example, many chemical processes follow the S-shaped Hill equation relation between input concentrations and output concentrations. That Hill equation pattern contradicts the fundamental Michaelis-Menten theory of enzyme kinetics. I use the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those components combine to determine the system's overall input-output relations. That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology. Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours. Natural selection may act primarily to modulate system properties within those broad constraints.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Eugene Koonin, Georg Luebeck and Sergei Maslov.},

@article{Kao-Huang1977,
abstract = {Binding of genome regulatory proteins to nonspecific DNA sites may play an important role in controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interactions of these proteins with their specific target DNA sequences. An estimate of the fraction of Escherichia coli lac repressor molecules bound in vivo to the operator region and to nonoperator sites on the E. coli chromosome is derived by measurement of the distribution of repressor between a minicell-producing E. coli strain (P678-54) and the DNA-free minicells derived therefrom. Assuming the minicell cytoplasm to be representative of that of the parent E. coli cells, we find that less than 10{\%} of the repressor tetramers of the average cell are free in solution; the remainder are presumed to be bound to the bacterial chromosome. The minimum in vivo value of the association constant for repressor to bulk nonoperator DNA (K(RD)) calculated from these results is about 10(3) M(-1), and analysis of the sources of error in the minicell experiment suggests that the actual in vivo value of K(RD) could be substantially greater. The value of K(RD), coupled with in vitro data on the ionic strength dependence of this parameter, can be used to estimate that the effective intracellular cation activity of E. coli is no greater than about 0.24 M (and probably no less than 0.17 M) in terms of sodium ion equivalents. The minicell distribution experiments also confirm that the association constant for the binding of inducer-repressor complex to bulk nonoperator DNA (K(RID)) is [unk] K(RD)in vivo. These results are used to calculate minimum in vivo values of K(RO) and K(RIO) (association constants for repressor and for inducer-repressor complex binding to operator) of about 10(12) M(-1) and about 10(9) M(-1), respectively. The results fit a quantitative model for operon regulation in which nonspecific DNA-repressor complexes play a key role in determining basal and constitutive levels of gene expression [von Hippel, P.

abstract = {Chemoreceptors in Escherichia coli are coupled to the flagella by a labile phosphorylated intermediate, CheY approximately P. Its activity can be inferred from the rotational bias of flagellar motors, but motor response is stochastic and limited to a narrow physiological range. Here we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor interactions of CheY approximately P with its phosphatase, CheZ, that reveal changes in the activity of the receptor kinase, CheA, resulting from the addition of attractants or repellents. Analyses of cheR and/or cheB mutants, defective in receptor methylation/demethylation, show that response sensitivity depends on the activity of CheB and the level of receptor modification. In cheRcheB mutants, the concentration of attractant that generates a half-maximal response is equal to the dissociation constant of the receptor. In wild-type cells, it is 35 times smaller. This amplification, together with the ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor, explains previous observations of high chemotactic gain.},

@article{Olsman2016,
abstract = {Many sensory systems, from vision and hearing in animals to signal transduction in cells, respond to fold changes in signal relative to background. Responding to fold change requires that the system senses signal on a logarithmic scale, responding identically to a change in signal level from 1 to 3, or from 10 to 30. It is an ongoing search in the field to understand the ways in which a logarithmic sensor can be implemented at the molecular level. In this work, we present evidence that logarithmic sensing can be implemented with a single protein, by means of allosteric regulation. Specifically, we find that mathematical models show that allosteric proteins can respond to stimuli on a logarithmic scale. Next, we present evidence from measurements in the literature that some allosteric proteins do operate in a parameter regime that permits logarithmic sensing. Finally, we present examples suggesting that allosteric proteins are indeed used in this capacity: allosteric proteins play a prominent role in systems where fold-change detection has been proposed. This finding suggests a role as logarithmic sensors for the many allosteric proteins across diverse biological processes.},

abstract = {Antibodies developed during HIV-1 infection lose efficacy as the viral spike mutates. We postulated that anti-HIV-1 antibodies primarily bind monovalently because HIV's low spike density impedes bivalent binding through inter-spike crosslinking, and the spike structure prohibits bivalent binding through intra-spike crosslinking. Monovalent binding reduces avidity and potency, thus expanding the range of mutations permitting antibody evasion. To test this idea, we engineered antibody-based molecules capable of bivalent binding through intra-spike crosslinking. We used DNA as a “molecular ruler” to measure intra-epitope distances on virion-bound spikes and construct intra-spike crosslinking molecules. Optimal bivalent reagents exhibited up to 2.5 orders of magnitude increased potency ({\textgreater}100-fold average increases across virus panels) and identified conformational states of virion-bound spikes. The demonstration that intra-spike crosslinking lowers the concentration of antibodies required for neutralization supports the hypothesis that low spike densities facilitate antibody evasion and the use of molecules capable of intra-spike crosslinking for therapy or passive protection.},

abstract = {Fitness landscapes of drug resistance constitute powerful tools to elucidate mutational pathways of antibiotic escape. Here, we developed a predictive biophysics-based fitness landscape of trimethoprim (TMP) resistance for Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We investigated the activity, binding, folding stability, and intracellular abundance for a complete set of combinatorial DHFR mutants made out of three key resistance mutations and extended this analysis to DHFR originated from Chlamydia muridarum and Listeria grayi We found that the acquisition of TMP resistance via decreased drug affinity is limited by a trade-off in catalytic efficiency. Protein stability is concurrently affected by the resistant mutants, which precludes a precise description of fitness from a single molecular trait. Application of the kinetic flux theory provided an accurate model to predict resistance phenotypes (IC50) quantitatively from a unique combination of the in vitro protein molecular properties. Further, we found that a controlled modulation of the GroEL/ES chaperonins and Lon protease levels affects the intracellular steady-state concentration of DHFR in a mutation-specific manner, whereas IC50 is changed proportionally, as indeed predicted by the model. This unveils a molecular rationale for the pleiotropic role of the protein quality control machinery on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, which, as we illustrate here, may drastically confound the evolutionary outcome. These results provide a comprehensive quantitative genotype-phenotype map for the essential enzyme that serves as an important target of antibiotic and anticancer therapies.},

abstract = {In prokaryotes, the construction of synthetic, multi-input promoters is constrained by the number of transcription factors that can simultaneously regulate a single promoter. This fundamental engineering constraint is an obstacle to synthetic biologists because it limits the computational capacity of engineered gene circuits. Here, we demonstrate that complex multi-input transcriptional logic gating can be achieved through the use of ligand-inducible chimeric transcription factors assembled from the LacI/GalR family. These modular chimeras each contain a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain, both of which are chosen from a library of possibilities. When two or more chimeras have the same DNA-binding domain, they independently and simultaneously regulate any promoter containing the appropriate operator site. In this manner, simple transcriptional AND gating is possible through the combination of two chimeras, and multiple-input AND gating is possible with the simultaneous use of three or even fou...},

abstract = {Neuromuscular acetylcholine receptors have long been a model system for understanding the mechanisms of operation of ligand-gated ion channels and fast chemical synapses. These five subunit membrane proteins have two allosteric (transmitter) binding sites and a distant ion channel domain. Occupation of the binding sites by agonist molecules transiently increases the probability that the channel is ion-permeable. Recent experiments show that the Monod, Wyman and Changeux formalism for allosteric proteins, originally developed for haemoglobin, is an excellent model for acetylcholine receptors. By using mutations and single-channel electrophysiology, the gating equilibrium constants for receptors with zero, one or two bound agonist molecules, and the agonist association and dissociation rate constants from both the closed- and open-channel conformations, have been estimated experimentally. The change in affinity for each transmitter molecule between closed and open conformations provides {\~{}}-5.1 kcal mol(-1) towards the global gating isomerization of the protein.},

@article{Mirny2010,
abstract = {Cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) to promoters and other regulatory regions is essential for precise gene expression. The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions between TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TF sites in regulatory regions. Recent genomic and functional studies, however, demonstrate a great deal of flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and identities of TF sites located in cis-regulatory regions. Such flexibility is inconsistent with cooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here, we demonstrate that strong cooperativity among noninteracting TFs can be achieved by their competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is analogous to cooperativity in another multimolecular complex: hemoglobin. This surprising analogy provides deep insights, with parallels between the heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g., the Bohr effect) and the roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin modifications in gene expression. Nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is consistent with several experimental studies, is equally applicable to repressors and activators, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity of regulatory regions, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary observations. Striking parallels between cooperativity in hemoglobin and in transcriptional regulation point to a general mechanism that can be used in various biological systems.},

We present a model for signal integration by mixed clusters of interacting two-state chemoreceptors. Our model results compare favorably to the results obtained by Sourjik and Berg with in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Importantly, we identify two distinct regimes of behavior, depending on the relative energies of the two states of the receptors. In regime I, coupling of receptors leads to high sensitivity, while in regime II, coupling of receptors leads to high cooperativity, i.e., high Hill coefficient. For homogeneous receptors, we predict an observable transition between regime I and regime II with increasing receptor methylation or amidation.},

LuxN, a nine-transmembrane domain protein from Vibrio harveyi, is the founding example of membrane-bound receptors for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers. We used mutagenesis and suppressor analyses to identify the AHL-binding domain of LuxN and discovered LuxN mutants that confer both decreased and increased AHL sensitivity. Our analysis of dose-response curves of multiple LuxN mutants pins these inverse phenotypes on quantifiable opposing shifts in the free-energy bias of LuxN for occupying its kinase and phosphatase states. To understand receptor activation and to characterize the pathway signaling parameters, we exploited a strong LuxN antagonist, one of fifteen small-molecule antagonists we identified. We find that quorum-sensing-mediated communication can be manipulated positively and negatively to control bacterial behavior and, more broadly, that signaling parameters can be deduced from in vivo data.},

We constructed a set of promoters in Escherichia coli in which promoter strength, transcription factor binding strength, and transcription factor copy numbers are systematically varied, and used messenger RNA (mRNA) fluorescence in situ hybridization to observe how these changes affected variability in gene expression. Our parameter-free models predicted the observed variability; hence, the molecular details of transcription dictate variability in mRNA expression, and transcriptional noise is specifically tunable and thus represents an evolutionarily accessible phenotypic parameter.},

Biochemical nonlinearity is encoded in the graph labels. Many central results in molecular biology can be systematically derived within this framework, including those for enzyme kinetics, allosteric proteins, G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, gene regulation at thermodynamic equilibrium, and protein post-translational modification. In the present paper, in response to new applications, which accommodate nonequilibrium mechanisms in eukaryotic gene regulation, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the framework. We show that, for any graph and any initial condition, the dynamics always reaches a steady state, which can be algorithmically calculated. If the graph is not strongly connected, which may occur in gene regulation, we show that the dynamics can exhibit flexible behavior that resembles multistability. We further reveal an unexpected equivalence between deterministic Laplacian dynamics and the master equations of continuous-time Markov processes, which allows rigorous treatment within the framework of stochastic, single-molecule mechanisms.},

Here, we study this process and compare different regulatory mechanisms based on repression with and without looping. Within a simple mathematical model for the lac operon, we show that regulation based on DNA looping, in addition to increasing the repression level, can reduce the fluctuations of transcription and, at the same time, decrease the sensitivity to changes in the number of regulatory proteins. Looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a mechanism to regulate the average properties of transcription and its fluctuations.},

The kinetic aspects of the allosteric model, however, have been often neglected, with the exception of hemoglobin and a few other proteins where conformational relaxations can be triggered by a short and intense laser pulse, and monitored by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Only recently the application of time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS), a direct structurally sensitive technique, unveiled the time scale of hemoglobin quaternary structural transition. In order to test the generality of the MWC kinetic model, we carried out a TR-WAXS investigation in parallel on adult human hemoglobin and on a recombinant protein (HbYQ) carrying two mutations at the active site [Leu(B10)Tyr and His(E7)Gln]. HbYQ seemed an ideal test because, although exhibiting allosteric properties, its kinetic and structural properties are different from adult human hemoglobin. The structural dynamics of HbYQ unveiled by TR-WAXS can be quantitatively accounted for by the MWC kinetic model. Interestingly, the main structural change associated with the R-T allosteric transition (i.e., the relative rotation and translation of the dimers) is approximately 10-fold slower in HbYQ, and the drop in the allosteric transition rate with ligand saturation is steeper. Our results extend the general validity of the MWC kinetic model and reveal peculiar thermodynamic properties of HbYQ. A possible structural interpretation of the characteristic kinetic behavior of HbYQ is also discussed.},

@article{Velyvis2007,
abstract = {The 306-kDa aspartate transcarbamoylase is a well studied regulatory enzyme, and it has emerged as a paradigm for understanding allostery and cooperative binding processes. Although there is a consensus that the cooperative binding of active site ligands follows the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, there is some debate about the binding of effectors such as ATP and CTP and how they influence the allosteric equilibrium between R and T states of the enzyme. In this article, the binding of substrates, substrate analogues, and nucleotides is studied, along with their effect on the R-T equilibrium by using highly deuterated, (1)H,(13)C-methyl-labeled protein in concert with methyl-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR. Although only the T state of the enzyme can be observed in spectra of wild-type unliganded aspartate transcarbamoylase, binding of active-site substrates shift the equilibrium so that correlations from the R state become visible, allowing the equilibrium constant (L') between ligand-saturated R and T forms of the enzyme to be measured quantitatively. The equilibrium constant between unliganded R and T forms (L) also is obtained, despite the fact that the R state is "invisible" in spectra, by means of an indirect process that makes use of relations that emerge from the fact that ligand binding and the R-T equilibrium are linked. Titrations with MgATP unequivocally establish that its binding directly perturbs the R-T equilibrium, consistent with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. This study emphasizes the utility of modern solution NMR spectroscopy in understanding protein function, even for systems with aggregate molecular masses in the hundreds of kilodaltons.},

abstract = {The concept of allostery in which macromolecules switch between two different conformations, is a central theme in biological processes ranging from gene regulation to cell signaling to enzymology. Allosteric enzymes pervade metabolic processes, yet a simple and unified treatment of the effects of allostery in enzymes has been lacking. In this work, we take the first step towards this goal by modeling allosteric enzymes and their interaction with two key molecular players - allosteric regulators and competitive inhibitors. We then apply this model to characterize existing data on enzyme activity, comment on how enzyme parameters (such as substrate binding affinity) can be experimentally tuned, and make novel predictions on how to control phenomena such as substrate inhibition.},

@article{Endres2006,
abstract = {The chemotaxis network in \textit{Escherichia coli} is remarkable for its sensitivity to small relative changes in the concentrations of multiple chemical signals over a broad range of ambient concentrations. Key to this sensitivity is an adaptation system that relies on methylation and demethylation (or deamidation) of specific modification sites of the chemoreceptors by the enzymes CheR and CheB, respectively. It was recently discovered that these enzymes can access five to seven receptors when tethered to a particular receptor. We show that these "assistance neighborhoods" are necessary for precise adaptation in a model for signaling by clusters of chemoreceptors. In agreement with experiment, model clusters composed of receptors of different types exhibit high sensitivity and precise adaptation over a wide range of chemical concentrations and the response of adapted clusters to addition/removal of attractant scales with free-energy change. We predict two limits of precise adaptation at large attractant concentrations: Either receptors reach full methylation and turn off, or receptors become saturated and cease to respond to attractant but retain their adapted activity.},

abstract = {Based on parameters governing promoter activity and using regulatory elements of the lac, ara and tet operon transcription control sequences were composed which permit the regulation in \textit{Escherichia coli} of several gene activities independently and quantitatively. The novel promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. \textit{Escherichia coli} host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as AraC from chromosomally located expression units provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products. The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.},

abstract = {The 50th anniversary of the classic Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model provides an opportunity to survey the broader conceptual and quantitative implications of this quintessential biophysical model. With the use of statistical mechanics, the mathematical implementation of the MWC concept links problems that seem otherwise to have no ostensible biological connection including ligand-receptor binding, ligand-gated ion channels, chemotaxis, chromatin structure and gene regulation. Hence, a thorough mathematical analysis of the MWC model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke. The goal of our review is twofold. First, we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of MWC molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands. Second, we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of MWC molecules tracks their sensory input, giving a sense of the "design" constraints faced by these receptors. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ever since the integration of Mendelian genetics into evolutionary biology in the early 20th century, evolutionary geneticists have for the most part treated genes and mutations as generic entities. However, recent observations indicate that all genes are not equal in the eyes of evolution. Evolutionarily relevant mutations tend to accumulate in hotspot genes and at specific positions within genes. Genetic evolution is constrained by gene function, the structure of genetic networks, and population biology. The genetic basis of evolution may be predictable to some extent, and further understanding of this predictability requires incorporation of the specific functions and characteristics of genes into evolutionary theory.},

abstract = {Filter-binding and gel mobility shift assays were used to analyse the kinetics of the interaction of Lac repressor with lac operator. A comparison of the two techniques reveals that filter-binding assays with tetrameric Lac repressor have often been misinterpreted. It has been assumed that all complexes of Lac repressor and lac operator DNA bind with equal affinity to nitrocellulose filters. This assumption is wrong. Sandwich or loop complexes where two lac operators bind to one tetrameric Lac repressor are not or are only badly retained on nitrocellulose filters under normal conditions. Taking this into account, dimeric and tetrameric Lac repressor do not show any DNA-length dependence of their association and dissociation rate constants when they bind to DNA fragments smaller than 2455 base-pairs carrying a single symmetric ideal lac operator. A ninefold increased association rate to ideal lac operator on ?? DNA is observed for tetrameric but not dimeric Lac repressor. It is presumably due to intersegment transfer involving lac operator-like sequences. ?? 1992.},

Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the ‘regulation factor'. This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

abstract = {With the increasing amount of experimental data on gene expression and regulation, there is a growing need for quantitative models to describe the data and relate them to their respective context. Thermodynamic models provide a useful framework for the quantitative analysis of bacterial transcription regulation. This framework can facilitate the quantification of vastly different forms of gene expression from several well-characterized bacterial promoters that are regulated by one or two species of transcription factors; it is useful because it requires only a few parameters. As such, it provides a compact description useful for higher-level studies (e.g. of genetic networks) without the need to invoke the biochemical details of every component. Moreover, it can be used to generate hypotheses on the likely mechanisms of transcriptional control.},

abstract = {Lactose repressor (LacI) is one of the best studied prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins till date. Detailed structural, biochemical and genetic studies are being carried out on LacI since four decades to understand its ligand binding properties and the basis of allosteric response. We applied directed evolution methods on LacI to generate mutants with altered allosteric properties. After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier. The mutant Lac repressors seem to operate as very good molecular switches by inducing gene expression at 1 microM of IPTG and confer 2-10 times higher level of gene expression as compared with the WT (wild -type).},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an essential component of all metabolic pathways. At the most basic level, a protein binds to a particular DNA sequence (operator) on the genome and either positively or negatively alters the level of transcription. Together, the protein and its operator form an epigenetic switch that regulates gene expression. In an effort to produce a 'better' switch, we have discovered novel facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We have uncovered a relationship between operator binding affinity and inducibility and demonstrated that the operator DNA is not a passive component of a genetic switch; it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity as well as translational efficiency. In addition, an operator's directionality can indirectly affect gene expression. Unraveling the basic properties of this classical epigenetic switch demonstrates that multiple factors must be optimized in designing a better switch.},

@article{Goeddel1977,
abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein has been modified with three sulfhydryl-specific reagents which form mixed disulfide adducts. Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) completely reacted with all three cysteine residues, whereas only partial reaction was observed with didansylcystine. Cysteines-107 and -140 reacted stoichiometrically with MMTS and DTNB, while Cys-281 was modified only at higher molar ratios. Didansylcystine reacted primarily with cysteines-107 and -140. Affinity of MMTS-modified repressor for 40 base pair operator DNA was decreased 30-fold compared to unmodified repressor, and this decrease correlated with modification of cysteine-281. DTNB-modified repressor bound operator DNA with a 50-fold weaker affinity than unmodified repressor. Modification of the lac repressor with didanylcystine decreased operator binding only 4-fold, and nonspecific DNA binding increased 3-fold compared to unmodified repressor. No change in the inducer equilibrium binding constant was observed following modification with any of these reagents. In contrast, inducer association and dissociation rate constants were decreased approximately 50-fold for repressor completely modified with MMTS or DTNB, while didansylcystine had minimal effect on inducer binding kinetics. Correlation between modification of Cys-281 and the observed decrease in rate constants indicates that this region of the protein regulates the accessibility of the sugar binding site. The parallel between the increase in the Kd for repressor binding to operator, the altered rate constant for inducer binding, and modification of cysteine-281 suggests that this region of the protein is crucially involved in the function of the repressor protein.},

Here, we describe a set of experiments where we modified a single inducer binding site in a dimeric repressor and examined its effect on induction. Based upon these observations, we have been able to calculate the thermodynamic parameters that are responsible for the allosteric properties that govern repressor function.

Five variants were generated, three variants (C4, C32 and C80) with wild-type like function and two co-repressor variants (C101 and C140) that are functionally inverted. To better resolve the residues that define new allosteric networks in the LacI variants, we conducted mutational tolerance analysis via saturation mutagenesis at each of the evolved positions to assess sensitivity to mutation-a hallmark of allosteric residues. To better understand the physicochemical bases of alternate allosteric function, variant LacIC80 was characterized to assess IPTG ligand binding at equilibrium, kinetically using stopped-flow, and via isothermal titration calorimetry. These data suggest that the conferred modulated DNA binding function observed for LacIC80, while thermodynamically similar to wild-type LacI, is mechanistically different from the wild-type repressor, suggesting a new allosteric network and communication route.},

This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

abstract = {The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60{\%} of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur.},

Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of \textit{Escherichia coli} offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in \textit{Escherichia coli} is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },

abstract = {Sensing extracellular changes initiates signal transduction and is the first stage of cellular decision-making. Yet relatively little is known about why one form of sensing biochemistry has been selected over another. To gain insight into this question, we studied the sensing characteristics of one of the biochemically simplest of sensors: the allosteric transcription factor. Such proteins, common in microbes, directly transduce the detection of a sensed molecule to changes in gene regulation. Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, we determined six sensing characteristics--the dynamic range, the Hill number, the intrinsic noise, the information transfer capacity, the static gain, and the mean response time--as a function of the biochemical parameters of individual sensors and of the number of sensors. We found that specifying one characteristic strongly constrains others. For example, a high dynamic range implies a high Hill number and a high capacity, and vice versa. Perhaps surprisingly, these constraints are so strong that most of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameter values. Within our approximations, we can calculate the probability distribution of the numbers of input molecules that maximizes information transfer and show that a population of one hundred allosteric transcription factors can in principle distinguish between more than four bands of input concentrations. Our results imply that allosteric sensors are unlikely to have been selected for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in the performance of many.},

abstract = {Gene expression is significantly stochastic making modeling of genetic networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for \textit{Escherichia coli} allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

abstract = {The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and selection. We show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding cooperativity between different sites. Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

abstract = {The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model was initially proposed to describe the allosteric properties of regulatory enzymes and subsequently extended to receptors. Yet despite GPCRs representing the largest family of receptors and drug targets, no study has systematically evaluated the MWC mechanism as it applies to GPCR allosteric ligands. We reveal how the recently described allosteric modulator, benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), behaves according to a strict, two-state MWC mechanism at the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). Despite having a low affinity for the M1 mAChR, BQCA demonstrated state dependence, exhibiting high positive cooperativity with orthosteric agonists in a manner that correlated with efficacy but negative cooperativity with inverse agonists. The activity of BQCA was significantly increased at a constitutively active M1 mAChR but abolished at an inactive mutant. Interestingly, BQCA possessed intrinsic signaling efficacy, ranging from near-quiescence to full agonism depending on the coupling efficiency of the chosen intracellular pathway. This latter cellular property also determined the difference in magnitude of positive cooperativity between BQCA and the orthosteric agonist, carbachol, across pathways. The lack of additional, pathway-biased, allosteric modulation by BQCA was confirmed in genetically engineered yeast strains expressing different chimeras between the endogenous yeast Gpa1 protein and human G$\alpha$ subunits. These findings define a chemical biological framework that can be applied to the study and classification of allosteric modulators across different GPCR families.},

At physiological repressor concentrations, repression at PR is predicted to be nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain highly active.

A prototypical example is the lac operon, one of the best-characterized genetic systems, which still poses serious challenges for understanding the results of combining its parts into novel setups.

Direct measurement, using Pt-C shadow width standards, was 9.6 +/- 0.2 nm long. Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

abstract = {We present here the results of a series of small-angle X-ray scattering studies aimed at understanding the role of conformational changes and structural flexibility in DNA binding and allosteric signaling in a bacterial transcription regulator, lactose repressor protein (LacI). Experiments were designed to detect possible conformational changes that occur when LacI binds either DNA or the inducer IPTG, or both. Our studies included the native LacI dimer of homodimers and a dimeric variant (R3), enabling us to probe conformational changes within the homodimers and distinguish them from those involving changes in the homodimer-homodimer relationships. The scattering data indicate that removal of operator DNA (oDNA) from R3 results in an unfolding and extension of the hinge helix that connects the LacI regulatory and DNA-binding domains. In contrast, only very subtle conformational changes occur in the R3 dimer-oDNA complex upon IPTG binding, indicative of small adjustments in the orientations of domains and/or subdomains within the structure. The binding of IPTG to native (tetrameric) LacI-oDNA complexes also appears to facilitate a modest change in the average homodimer-homodimer disposition. Notably, the crystal structure of the native LacI-oDNA complex differs significantly from the average solution conformation. The solution scattering data are best fit by an ensemble of structures that includes (1) ??? 60{\%} of the V-shaped dimer of homodimers observed in the crystal structure and (2) ??? 40{\%} of molecules with more "open" forms, such as those generated when the homodimers move with respect to each other about the tetramerization domain. In gene regulation, such a flexible LacI would be beneficial for the interaction of its two DNA-binding domains, positioned at the tips of the V, with the required two of three LacI operators needed for full repression. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein (LacI) was among the very first genetic regulatory proteins discovered, and more than 1000 members of the bacterial LacI/GalR family are now identified. LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response. Thus, this family exhibits a symphony of variations by which transcriptional control is achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Allostery, the modulation of function of a protein at one site by the binding of a ligand at a different site, is a property of many proteins. Two kinetically distinct models have been proposed: i) The induced fit model in which the ligand binds to the protein and then induces the conformational change. ii) The population selection model, in which the protein spontaneously undergoes a conformational change, which is then 'captured' by the ligand. Using measured kinetic constants for the lac repressor the contribution of population selection vs. induced dissociation is quantified by simulating the kinetics of allostery. At very low inducer concentration, both mechanisms contribute significantly. Total induction, though, is small under these conditions. At increasing levels of induction the induced dissociation mechanism soon dominates, first due to binding of one inducer, and then from two inducers binding. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

U.S.A., 71:593-597] model of lactose repressor (LacR) (14 x 6.0 x 4.5 nm) represented the shape of free or operator-bound LacR in solution. The model predicts a 14 nm length for bound LacR. Direct measurement, using Pt-C shadow width standards, was 9.6 +/- 0.2 nm long. Using the Steitz model, we generated a distribution of measurements and converted them into a distribution of shadow widths using gold ball standards. Direct measurement of LacR produced a narrower shadow width distribution with a larger mean size than the Steitz model predicted. Measurement along two orthogonal axes of negatively stained LacR images generated a size distribution, also converted into a shadow width distribution using the gold ball standards. Since the experimental shadow width distribution exactly matched the shadow width distribution derived theoretically from negatively stained LacR, our negative-stained images are representative of LacR's conformation in solution. Approximately 56{\%} of negatively stained LacR had a V-shaped fold around an axis orthogonal to its length, bringing the DNA binding domains of each dimer adjacent. This open end of the V binds single operator DNA. The other 44{\%} of the LacR tetramer is in the extended form with its DNA binding sites at opposite ends. Although the V-shaped conformation has a closed hinge with the dimers associated along a side, the extended open-hinged state remains important since LacR must bind two distant operator sites for full repression. Our measurements predict the normal presence of both conformations in nearly equal amounts, suggesting that both are equally active in repressing the lac operon.},

Mutations introduced into the DNA binding domain and the effector binding pocket affect the repressor's ability to respond to its environment. We have demonstrated how the observed phenotype is a consequence of altering the thermodynamic equilibrium constants. We discuss mutant repressors, which (1) show tighter repression; (2) induce with a previously noninducing species, orthonitrophenyl-$\beta$-d-galactoside; and (3) transform an inducible switch to one that is corepressed. The ability of point mutations to change multiple thermodynamic constants, and hence drastically alter the repressor's phenotype, shows how allosteric proteins can perform a wide array of similar yet distinct functions such as that exhibited in the Lac/Gal family of bacterial repressors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Perhaps surprisingly, one of the theoretical tools that has been used with great success on problems ranging from how cells communicate with their environment and each other to the nature of the organization of proteins and lipids within the cell membrane is statistical mechanics. A knee-jerk reaction to the use of statistical mechanics in the description of cellular processes is that living organisms are so far from equilibrium that one has no business even thinking about it. But such reactions are probably too hasty given that there are many regimes in which, because of a separation of timescales, for example, such an approach can be a useful first step.

abstract = {One of the paramount goals of synthetic biology is to have the ability to tune transcriptional networks to targeted levels of expression at will. As a step in that direction, we have constructed a set of 18 unique binding sites for E. coli RNA Polymerase (RNAP) $\delta^{70}$ holoenzyme, designed using a model of sequence-dependent binding energy combined with a thermodynamic model of transcription to produce a targeted level of gene expression. This promoter set allows us to determine the correspondence between the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules or protein products and the predicted promoter binding energies measured in k(B)T energy units. These binding sites adhere on average to the predicted level of gene expression over 3 orders of magnitude in constitutive gene expression, to within a factor of 3 in both protein and mRNA copy number. With these promoters in hand, we then place them under the regulatory control of a bacterial repressor and show that again there is a strict correspondence between the measured and predicted levels of expression, demonstrating the transferability of the promoters to an alternate regulatory context. In particular, our thermodynamic model predicts the expression from our promoters under a range of repressor concentrations between several per cell up to over 100 per cell. After correcting the predicted polymerase binding strength using the data from the unregulated promoter, the thermodynamic model accurately predicts the expression for the simple repression strains to within 30{\%}. Demonstration of modular promoter design, where parts of the circuit (such as RNAP/TF binding strength and transcription factor copy number) can be independently chosen from a stock list and combined to give a predictable result, has important implications as an engineering tool for use in synthetic biology.},

A comparison of the two techniques reveals that filter-binding assays with tetrameric Lac repressor have often been misinterpreted. It has been assumed that all complexes of Lac repressor and lac operator DNA bind with equal affinity to nitrocellulose filters. This assumption is wrong. Sandwich or loop complexes where two lac operators bind to one tetrameric Lac repressor are not or are only badly retained on nitrocellulose filters under normal conditions. Taking this into account, dimeric and tetrameric Lac repressor do not show any DNA-length dependence of their association and dissociation rate constants when they bind to DNA fragments smaller than 2455 base-pairs carrying a single symmetric ideal lac operator. A ninefold increased association rate to ideal lac operator on ?? DNA is observed for tetrameric but not dimeric Lac repressor. It is presumably due to intersegment transfer involving lac operator-like sequences. ?? 1992.},

A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3−-activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3− activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

The operon model rationally depicted how genetic mechanisms can control metabolic events in response to environmental stimuli via coordinated transcription of a set of genes with related function (e.g. metabolism of lactose). The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms. These two models have shaped our view of modern molecular biology and captivated the attention of a surprisingly broad range of scientists. More recently, the lactose repressor monomer was used as a model system for experimental and theoretical explorations of protein folding mechanisms.

Our numbers of E and sigma(70) per cell, which are consistent with most of the primary data in the literature, suggest that in vivo (i) only a minor fraction of RNA polymerase ({\textless}20{\%}) is involved in elongation and (ii) sigma(70) is in excess of total E. Modeling the partitioning of RNA polymerase between promoters, nonspecific DNA binding sites, and the cytoplasm suggested that even weak promoters will be saturated with Esigma(70) in vivo unless nonspecific DNA binding by Esigma(70) is rather significant. In addition, the model predicted that sigmas compete for binding to E only when their total number exceeds the total amount of RNA polymerase (excluding that involved in elongation) and that weak promoters will be preferentially subjected to sigma competition.},

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of \textit{Escherichia coli} offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {We report that during cortical development in the mouse embryo, reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) critically regulates Notch signaling by antagonizing the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands, which is mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10). In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},

abstract = {Binding of the Lac repressor to its operator DNA controls the expression of the genes of the lac operon of \textit{Escherichia coli}. Lac repressor's affinity for the lac operator is diminished by an inducer that affects the structure of the repressor tetramer. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant Lac repressor i-t gene, whose product, the LacR-t repressor, shows a higher affinity for the inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and a lower affinity for the lac operator than the wild-type repressor. We show that the altered phenotype is due to a single amino acid residue replacement; the alanine residue at position 110 in the wild-type is replaced by threonine in i-t. Other amino acid residues in position 110 have been shown to result in an i-s phenotype. For the i-s-substitution of alanine 110 with lysine we demonstrate an increase in the affinity for operator DNA and a decrease in the affinity for IPTG. Thus, A110--{\textgreater} K shows the opposite effect to A110--{\textgreater}T on the repressor protein. We explain the phenotype of the LacR mutants by displacements of the conformational equilibrium for the dimeric repressor unit between RR (high operator affinity, low inducer affinity) and R*R* (low operator affinity, high inducer affinity) towards R*R* in the i-t and towards RR in the i-s mutant in position 110 with respect to the wild-type. The putative structures of the wild-type and mutant Lac repressors confirm this conclusion.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders of magnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in \textit{Escherichia coli}.},

Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {The lactose repressor protein (LacI) was among the very first genetic regulatory proteins discovered, and more than 1000 members of the bacterial LacI/GalR family are now identified. LacI has been the prototype for understanding how transcription is controlled using small metabolites to modulate protein association with specific DNA sites. This understanding has been greatly expanded by the study of other LacI/GalR homologues. A general picture emerges in which the conserved fold provides a scaffold for multiple types of interactions - including oligomerization, small molecule binding, and protein-protein binding - that in turn influence target DNA binding and thereby regulate mRNA production. Although many different functions have evolved from this basic scaffold, each homologue retains functional flexibility: For the same protein, different small molecules can have disparate impact on DNA binding and hence transcriptional outcome. In turn, binding to alternative DNA sequences may impact the degree of allosteric response. Thus, this family exhibits a symphony of variations by which transcriptional control is achieved. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Among these techniques, NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here, we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions.

The structures of the apo repressor and the repressor bound to effector molecules are compared in atomic detail. All effectors examined here bind to the repressor in the same location and are anchored to the repressor through hydrogen bonds to several hydroxyl groups of the sugar ring. Inducer molecules form a more extensive hydrogen-bonding network compared to anti-inducers and neutral effector molecules. The structures of these effector molecules suggest that the O6 hydroxyl on the galactoside is essential for establishing a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network that bridges the N-terminal and C-terminal sub-domains. The altered hydrogen bonding can account in part for the different structural conformations of the repressor, and is vital for the allosteric transition. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction.

abstract = {Abstract The recombinant production of Lac repressor (LacI) in \textit{Escherichia coli} is complicated by its ubiquitous use as a regulatory element in commercially-available expression vectors and host strains. While LacI-regulated expression systems are often used to produce recombinant LacI, the product can be heterogeneous and unsuitable for some studies. Alternative approaches include using unregulated vectors which typically suffer from low yield or vectors with promoters induced by metabolically active sugars which can dilute isotope labels necessary for certain biophysical studies. Here, an optimized expression system and isolation protocol for producing various constructs of LacI is introduced which eliminates these complications. The expression vector is an adaptation of the pASK backbone wherein expression of the lacI gene is regulated by an anhydrotetracyline inducible tetA promoter and the host strain lacks the lacI gene. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are nearly 2-fold greater than those previously reported. Notably, the new expression system is also able to produce the isolated regulatory domain of LacI without co-expression of the full-length protein and without any defects in cell viability, eliminating the inconvenient requirement for strict monitoring of cell densities during pre-culturing. Typical yields in highly deuterated minimal medium are significantly greater than those previously reported. Characterization by solution {\{}NMR{\}} shows that LacI constructs produced using this expression system are highly homogenous and functionally active. },

After testing several hosts and expression vectors, a robust expression and screening system was optimised for identifying LacI variants with altered allosteric properties. After two rounds of error prone PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and shuffling, four mutants were selected from several thousand mutants, for their ability to induce reporter gene expression at 1 microM of isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The observed combination of mutations in these four improved LacIs was not reported earlier.

This formalism is based on the Fisher information matrix, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. The manifold boundary approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic processes.},

@article{Razo-Mejia2014,
abstract = {With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, many large scale experimental efforts aim to map genotypic variability among individuals. This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold-change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates. We then implement the model to analyze the sensitivity of the promoter sequence to the regulatory output, and predict the potential for regulation to evolve due to point mutations in the promoter region.},

@article{Kern2003,
abstract = {The biomolecular conformational changes often associated with allostery are, by definition, dynamic processes. Recent publications have disclosed the role of pre-existing equilibria of conformational substates in this process. In addition, the role of dynamics as an entropic carrier of free energy of allostery has been investigated. Recent work thus shows that dynamics is pivotal to allostery, and that it constitutes much more than just the move from the ‘T'-state to the ‘R'-state. Emerging computational studies have described the actual pathways of allosteric change.},
