    description: >
      A distinctive feature of what we call "Life" has to do with the ability
      of organisms to gather information from the environment, generate an 
      internal representation of such information, and respond accordingly to
      maximize the chances of surviving. This website presents the text of my
      Ph.D. dissertation in which I explore the ability of cells to process
      information at the molecular level. All research, unless otherwise 
      stated, was performed at the California Institute of Technology under 
      the guidance of <a href="http://rpgroup.caltech.edu/">Rob Phillips</a>.
